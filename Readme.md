Assignment: Google Calendar Integration with MERN Stack
Assignment Requirements:
1. Develop a Web Interface:
- Build a web interface featuring a Google Sign-In button.
2. Google Sign-In and Calendar Access:
- Configure the Sign-In button to prompt users for Google Calendar access.
- Securely store the resulting Google access token in the database.
3. Display “Create Calendar Event” Option:
- Once the Google access token is obtained, display a “Create Calendar Event” button on the interface.
4. Event Creation Popup:
- When the “Create Calendar Event” button is clicked, display a popup form requesting the event name, date, and
time.
5. Event Creation in Google Calendar:
- On form submission, use the Google Calendar API to create the event in the user’s Google Calendar.
6. Display Events in a Table:
- Show a table on the interface listing event details once an event is created.
7. Optional Brownie Points (Not Mandatory):
- Implement a feature to watch Google Calendar events. If a new event is created directly in Google Calendar,
ensure it reflects in the table on the web interface after a page refresh.
Timeline:
- Submission deadline: Sunday, midnight.
- If working on the brownie points, submit by Monday, first half.
Must-Have Criteria:
1. The application must be fully functional.
2. Do not use any CSS libraries; use vanilla CSS only.
3. Follow best coding practices for modularity, readability, and production readiness.
4. Use the MERN stack exclusively; no other tech stack will be accepted.
5. Design the UI with a focus on user experience and aesthetics, as this will be part of the evaluation.  -->
